    "The most common form of regularization is L2 regularization. In this case we add a term to our loss function that penalizes the squared value of all the weights/parameters that we are optimizing.

This encourages our model to prefer that all inputs to a layer are used a little rather than a few inputs are used a lot. This property is intuitively quite nice to have as our model will be used maximally and we have less unused weights.\n",
