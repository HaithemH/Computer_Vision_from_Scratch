## How do I run .sh scripts? 

Give execute permission to your script:

```python
chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh
```

And to run your script:

```python
/path/to/yourscript.sh
```

Since **.** refers to the current directory: if **yourscript.sh** is in the current directory, you can simplify this to:

```python
./yourscript.sh
```
