    "**Answer** The same problems for monocular vision, the camera models are constructed based on that the light do not scattered nor absorbed in the medium between the camera, the object and the source of ligth. This modification in the propagation of the ligth in the medium, change the cameras systems and made them blur the image in most ocassions. And because of the estimation error stereo vision aplications, such as 3D reconstrution are often not possible, if the model do not take into account the medium.\n"
